## Software Documentation Overview

Software documentation, per Forward, is any artifact made as part of the
software development process that is intended to communicate information
about the software system about which it was written.

FIXME: Insert Undraw image here about docs.

In this lesson, students will learn about the different types of software
development and practices and tools to enable better documentation.
